"""## Report: Chunking Strategy and Embedding Model Choice

### Chunking Strategy
The chunking strategy uses LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with a `chunk_size` of 500 characters and a `chunk_overlap` of 50 characters. This configuration was chosen after experimenting with chunk sizes of 300, 500, and 1000 characters. A chunk size of 500 strikes a balance between capturing sufficient context for semantic understanding and producing embeddings that are specific enough for precise retrieval. Smaller chunks (e.g., 300) risked fragmenting narratives, losing contextual coherence, while larger chunks (e.g., 1000) produced embeddings that were too general, potentially reducing retrieval accuracy for specific issues. The overlap of 50 characters ensures continuity between chunks, preserving semantic connections across splits, especially for longer narratives where sentence boundaries might otherwise disrupt meaning. The `separators` list prioritizes splitting at paragraph breaks, newlines, and periods to align chunks with natural text boundaries, enhancing readability and coherence. Only the "Consumer complaint narrative" column is chunked, with other columns stored as metadata.

### Embedding Model Choice
The `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model was selected for generating embeddings due to its efficiency and performance in natural language processing tasks. This model, with 384-dimensional embeddings, is lightweight (22M parameters) and optimized for semantic similarity tasks, making it suitable for encoding the chunked "Consumer complaint narrative" texts for retrieval-augmented generation. It performs well on short to medium-length texts, which aligns with the chunked narratives (500 characters). Compared to larger models like `all-MPNet-base-v2`, it offers faster inference and lower memory requirements, crucial for processing potentially large datasets like the CFPB complaints. The model's robustness in capturing semantic meaning ensures effective similarity searches in the FAISS vector store, while its open-source availability and community support make it a practical choice for this project.

"""## Report: Analysis and Improvements

The RAG pipeline performed well for broad questions with clear context in the retrieved chunks (e.g., 'What are common issues with credit card complaints?' scored 4), providing relevant answers based on the 'Consumer complaint narrative' data. However, specific questions like 'How are late fees handled in credit card disputes?' scored lower (2) due to insufficient context in the top-5 chunks, indicating a need for better chunk selection or a larger k value. The prompt template effectively guided the LLM to use only provided context, avoiding hallucination.

### Improvements
- Increase k to 10 for broader context.
- Fine-tune chunking strategy (e.g., adjust chunk_size from Task 2) to capture more specific details.
- Use a more powerful LLM (e.g., a larger Mistral variant) for better reasoning.
- Implement re-ranking of retrieved chunks based on relevance scores.
